This file breifly explains the steps I took to reduce the raw data from UC Irvine's Census database.
On Tuesday, 2023-09-05, following group discussion, we decided to limit the scope of our data to the following:
    • Countries with top 5 or top 10 gdp per capita (tbd).
    • Continuous: age, edu-num, hour-per-week.
    • Categorical: workclass, occupation.
