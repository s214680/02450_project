Main idea: To carry out a PCA for Visualisation and Clustering

Main Steps:
1. Combine both the continuous and one-hot encoded categorical variables
- Load the dataset we will use into a pandas DataFrame.
- Segregate continous and categorical variables.
- Apply one-hot encoding to convert the categorical variables into a format suitable for PCA.

2. Standarise the dataset to make sure each attribute will have a mean of 0 and a standard deviaiton of 1

3. Apply PCA and reduce the data to 2 or 3 dimensions:
- Apply the PCA algorithm to the data.
- Choose the number of components for visualisation, mainly depends on the variance explained by the components.

4. Plot the data in the reduced space:
- Visualise the data in the reduced dimensionality space
- By coloring points based on attributes like 'income':
    we can identify patterns, clusters or relationships between variables.
